philosophy: This is our project area for keeping track of the competitive landscape.
  We enjoy understanding the space we are operating in, and understanding what the
  competition looks like. We don't see a problem with being open and transparent about
  our work to map out the competitive landscape. We feel it should be open, and demonstrate
  that we have a handle on what is happening across the real time, streaming, webhook,
  and event-driven world. We track on all of the challenges we face when trying to
  reach and differentiate ourselves in a crowded market.

  details: |-
    Amazon Kinesis Firehose is the easiest way to load&nbsp;streaming data&nbsp;into AWS. It can capture, transform,&nbsp;and load streaming data into&nbsp;Amazon Kinesis Analytics,&nbsp;Amazon S3,&nbsp;Amazon Redshift, and&nbsp;Amazon Elasticsearch Service, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards you&rsquo;re already using today. It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration. It can also batch, compress, and encrypt the data before loading it, minimizing the amount of storage used at the destination and increasing security.
    You can easily create a Firehose delivery stream from the&nbsp;AWS Management Console, configure it with a few clicks, and start sending data to the stream from hundreds of thousands of data sources to be loaded continuously to AWS &ndash; all in just a few minutes.
    With Amazon Kinesis Firehose, you only pay for the amount of data you transmit through the service. There is no minimum fee or setup cost.

  details: Azure Event Hubs is a hyper-scale telemetry ingestion service that collects,
    transforms, and stores millions of events. As a distributed streaming platform,
    it gives you low latency and configurable time retention, which enables you to
    ingress massive amounts of telemetry into the cloud and read the data from multiple
    applications using publish-subscribe semantics.

    SignalR. ASP.NET Core SignalR is an&nbsp;open source library&nbsp;that simplifies
    the process of adding real-time web functionality to applications over HTTP. This
    real-time functionality allows the web server to push content updates to connected
    clients. As a result, clients are updated without the need to poll the server,
    or submit new HTTP requests for updates.
