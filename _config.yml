  description: Azure Event Hubs is a hyper-scale telemetry ingestion service that
    collects, transforms, and stores millions of events. As a distributed streaming
    platform, it gives you low latency and configurable time retention, which enables
    you to ingress massive amounts of telemetry into the cloud and read the data from
    multiple applications using publish-subscribe semantics.

    Core SignalR. ASP.NET Core SignalR is an&nbsp;open source library&nbsp;that simplifies
    the process of adding real-time web functionality to applications over HTTP. This
    real-time functionality allows the web server to push content updates to connected
    clients. As a result, clients are updated without the need to poll the server,
    or submit new HTTP requests for updates.
