philosophy: This is our project area for keeping track of the competitive landscape.
  We enjoy understanding the space we are operating in, and understanding what the
  competition looks like. We don't see a problem with being open and transparent about
  our work to map out the competitive landscape. We feel it should be open, and demonstrate
  that we have a handle on what is happening across the real time, streaming, webhook,
  and event-driven world. We track on all of the challenges we face when trying to
  reach and differentiate ourselves in a crowded market.

  name: Azure Event Hubs
  description: Azure Event Hubs is a hyper-scale telemetry ingestion service that
    collects, transforms, and stores millions of events. As a distributed streaming
    platform, it gives you low latency and configurable time retention, which enables
    you to ingress massive amounts of telemetry into the cloud and read the data from
    multiple applications using publish-subscribe semantics.

  description: The Azure SignalR Service is an Azure service based on&nbsp;ASP.NET
    Core SignalR. ASP.NET Core SignalR is an&nbsp;open source library&nbsp;that simplifies
    the process of adding real-time web functionality to applications over HTTP. This
    real-time functionality allows the web server to push content updates to connected
    clients. As a result, clients are updated without the need to poll the server,
    or submit new HTTP requests for updates.
